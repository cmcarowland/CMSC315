## Project 3
- [x] Create a binary search tree class that
    - [x] Accepts string based preorder representation of a BST
        - [x] Catorgorize as
            - [x] Not a BST
            - [x] Is a BST
            - [x] Is a BST but is imbalanced
                - [x] IF imbalanced or non BST
                    - [x] Create new tree from data and 
                        - [x] Print
                        - [x] Print old height
                        - [x] Print new height
    - [x] Detect errors in string variation
        - [x] Incomplete Tree
        - [x] Data is Not an Integer
        - [x] Extra Characters at the End
        - [x] Missing Left Parenthesis
        - [x] Missing Right Parentheses
    - [x] Constructor that takes string and constructs BST
    - [x] Constructor that takes ArrayList of ints and constructs a BST
    - [x] Method that prints the BST in indented format
    - [x] Method that returns tree is BST
    - [x] Method that refutns if BST is balanced
    - [x] Method that returns height of BST
    - [x] Method that returns BST as Array
- [x] Create a CHECKED exception that is thrown when a tree with invalid syntax is input
- [x] Create a class
    - [x] Main entry point for the application
    - [x] Repeatedly accepts user input and displays the results
- [x] Create Test Cases 
    - [x] TestComplete
    - [x] TestIncomplete
