## Project 4
- [x] Class for Vertex
    - [x] Immutable class
    - [x] X and Y coords
    - [x] index of node

- [x] Graph class
    - [x] A method to add a vertex
    - [x] A method to add an edge
    - [x] A method that checks whether the graph has cycles
    - [x] A method to check whether the graph is connected
    - [x] A method that returns a list of vertices resulting from a depth-first graph search
    - [x] A method that returns a list of vertices resulting from a breadth-first graph search

- The third class is should be an extension of the javafx Pane class that visually displays the
graph. It should contain an event handler that responds to mouse clicks that creates new vertices
and a method that is called to draw edges.

    - [x] Event handlers for vertex addition

- The fourth class should contain the main method and should create the GUI including all the
